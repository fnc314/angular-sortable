## Angular sorTable

A package used for sorting tables easily with HTML/Angular Directive Attributes

#### NOTES

1. This table requires the use of symantic HTML tables (i.e. `<table><thead><tr><th>Header</th></tr></thead></table>`)
2. Styles included with this rely on unicode characters and no special glyphs
3. Feel free to do whatever you want with this code (even copy/paste, I don't care)
